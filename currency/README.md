After cloning the project run the following commands in a CLI to install the library

```sh
❯ cd /path/to/workspace/3-musketeers/currency
❯ npm install # or yarn

```

To execute the programm simply run:

```sh
❯ node cli.js
```
After a few seconds a result looking like the following will be displayed:

```sh

However, you can search the exhange rate you want like for example by running:
```sh
❯ node cli.js 5 dkk eur
```
wich gives in output:
```sh
5 DKK = 0.6693709250000001 EUR
```
